Welcome to EvoGuess's documentation!
====================================

Framework for hardness estimating of SAT instances by decomposition set searching.
Some Boolean formula is estimated in the following way:

1. the algorithm **chooses** decomposition set of some variables of the Boolean formula;
2. the original formula is **splits** into a number of simpler formulas using chosen decomposition set;
3. the resulting simpler formulas are **solved** and statistics of measures are collected;
4. the hardness is **estimated** hardness using special function.

Now more about each stage.

Choosing
--------

Metaheuristic algorithms, in particular evolutionary ones, are used to choose decomposition sets.
While working algorithm builds new decomposition sets based on previously estimated decomposition sets.
Special functions are used to estimate them.

Splitting
---------

To split original formula into a number of simpler formulas, the values of variables from decomposition set are fixed.
Each fixed value of variable *x* splits the original formula in two: the case of the positive literal of *x* and the case of the negative literal *Â¬x*.
